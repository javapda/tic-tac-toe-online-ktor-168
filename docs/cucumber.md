## describe
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) is a tool that helps people test software by turning the way you describe what the software should do into real tests. Imagine you’re writing a story about how an app should work, but instead of just telling the story, Cucumber can read it and then check if the app is doing what it’s supposed to.
* Let’s say you have a game, and you want to make sure that when you click a "Start" button, the game actually starts. With Cucumber, you would write that in a simple, human-friendly way, like this:
   ```
  Scenario: Start the game
    Given I am on the game start screen
    When I click the "Start" button
    Then the game should begin
   ```
  
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) understands this story and checks if your
  game behaves the way the story says. It's great
  because both non-technical people (like a teacher)
  and technical people (like a developer) can 
  understand and work together to make sure the 
  software is working correctly.

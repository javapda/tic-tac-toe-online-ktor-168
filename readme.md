## Why?
When working on the [Tic-Tac-Toe Online Project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/366)
I found that while running `Solve in IDE` there were version issues. Namely, I was using
more modern versions ([Ktor version 2.3.12](https://ktor.io/docs/welcome.html)) of Ktor, 
but the Hyperskill `Solve in IDE` appeared to use
[Ktor version 1.6.8](https://ktor.io/docs/old/welcome.html).

This alternate version of the [Tic-Tac-Toe Online Project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/366)
attempts to remedy the problem by re-writing, starting at [Stage 3/5](https://hyperskill.org/projects/366/stages/2168/implement) of the project to see if
I have better luck.

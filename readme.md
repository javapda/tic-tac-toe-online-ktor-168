## Why?
When working on the [Tic-Tac-Toe Online Project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/366)
I found that while running Solve in IDE there were version issues. Namely, I was using
more modern versions of Ktor, but the Hyperskill Solve in IDE appeared to use version 1.6.8.

This alternate version of the [Tic-Tac-Toe Online Project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/366)
attempts to remedy the problem by re-writing, starting at [Stage 3/5](https://hyperskill.org/projects/366/stages/2168/implement) of the project to see if
I have better luck.
